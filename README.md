## Stanford CS143-Compilers

---

### What is CS143?
A course covering the basic principle and implementation of Compiler.
More info on the [**course homepage**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
I follow the class on [**edx**](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+2T2020/home), but videos are also available on Bilibili.

#### Tips

Since the avaliable videos are **relatively short**, 
- if you are taking courses about compilers in school, you can use this course as a review and ***a chance to get your hands dirty***. 
- If you are self-learning, you may need to spend more time on the basic theory by reading books(eg.*"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools"*) etc.
